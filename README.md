Tiny houses not only offer sustainable living arrangements, but also pose a solution to poverty and homelessness. At Team Tiny House, we aim to design and build a tiny house on wheels made from sustainably sourced materials, complete with renewable energy, plumbing, and air conditioning. This tiny house will then be the basis of tiny house kits (which can be assembled by three people or less) that we will build and donate to high schools in areas of need.
This is our website for this club.
